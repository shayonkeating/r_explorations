# Question 01
# 1) starting in terminal CLI cd to the directory of the db and enter
# sqlite3 imdb.db

# this will initiate sqlite and load the db

#Create a table named director_info using SQLite; the columns are: Director_ID, and
#Director_Name. The Director_ID should be the primary key.

# CREATE TABLE director_info (
#    Director_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
#    Director_Name TEXT NOT NULL
# );

# 2) Import the entire data from the CSV file into the director_info table using the #SQLite.import command (see helpful resources below). Verify that your data was imported #correctly.

# enable importing CSV files
# .mode csv

# specify csv file to import into the director info table
# .import directors.csv director_info

# verify the import using a sql command to check
# SELECT * FROM director_info LIMIT 10;

# Output:
#1,"Aamir Khan"
#2,"Aaron Sorkin"
#3,"Abdellatif Kechiche"
#4,"Abhishek Chaubey"
#5,"Abhishek Kapoor"
#6,"Adam Elliot"
#7,"Adam McKay"
